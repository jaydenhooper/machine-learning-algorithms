## Machine Learning Algorithms
This project is to learn how to implement basic machine learning algorithms from scratch.

### K-Nearest Neighbours
The first project I will be implementing is KNN. 
The wine data set was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
datasets/wine).

#### TODO 
- [ ] Create a report.pdf to show
    - [ ] predicted class labels of each instance in the test set using k=1 with min-max normalization for each feature
    - [ ] The classification accuracy for k=1 on the test set with min-max normalization for each feature
    - [ ] Classification accuracy for k=3, compare against k=1
    - [ ] Discuss advantages/disadvantages of kNN method.
    - [ ] Discuss the impact of increasing and decreasing k (too large/small)
    - [ ] Describe applying k-fold cross validation for the dataset where k=5 (number of folds)
        - [ ] - State the major steps
